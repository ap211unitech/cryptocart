    ```bash
    cd client && yarn install
    ```
    
    ```bash
    cd hardhat && yarn install
    ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:

    ```bash
    cd hardhat && yarn hardhat compile
    ```

4. Deploy the smart contract:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat vars set ETHERSCAN_API_KEY 
    ```

    ```bash
    npx hardhat vars set ALCHEMY_KEY 
    ```

    ```bash
    npx hardhat vars set SEPOLIA_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY 
    ```

    ```bash
    cd hardhat && yarn hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
    ```

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    cd client && yarn dev
    ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet using MetaMask.
2. Browse through the product listings.
3. Purchase any product
4. Proceed to checkout and confirm the transaction using your cryptocurrency.
5. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain.

### Smart Contracts
